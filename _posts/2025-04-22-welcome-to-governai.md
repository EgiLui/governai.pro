# Step 1: Identify the Data Governance Leadership & Define the Scope

> Part of the *10-Step Data Governance Implementation Series*  
> Written for organisations building practical, scalable governance frameworks for responsible data management.

## Introduction: Why This Step Matters

Before drafting policies or deploying tools, the first step in implementing data governance is to define **who will lead** the programme and **what exactly will be governed**. These two decisions determine how authority flows, how fast the programme will scale, and whether it will gain or lose traction across the organisation.

Governance isnâ€™t about control for controlâ€™s sake. Itâ€™s about creating clarity and accountabilityâ€”something that begins with leadership and scope.

---

## 1. Defining Governance Leadership

Effective data governance leadership must be **strategic**, **tactical**, and **operational**. Rather than assigning a single leader or generic committee, the leadership structure should include distinct roles aligned with real organisational influence.

### Strategic Level â€“ Direction and Sponsorship

- **Executive Sponsor**: Advocates for the programme at the board or senior management level  
- **Chief Information Officer (CIO)**: Aligns data governance with digital strategy and IT infrastructure  
- **Chief Data Officer (CDO)**: Leads data vision, risk oversight, and governance strategy

These individuals drive funding, define organisational risk appetite, and elevate governance to strategic importance.

### Tactical Level â€“ Policy and Oversight

- **Data Governance Council**: A cross-functional team of business and technical leaders who review and approve policies, resolve disputes, and prioritise governance work  
- **Data Governance Lead or Programme Manager**: Coordinates the programmeâ€™s execution and alignment  
- **Chief Data Steward**: Oversees data stewardship activities, often across domains

This level ensures operational cohesion and cross-departmental coordination.

### Operational Level â€“ Execution and Stewardship

- **Business Data Stewards**: Validate and maintain business definitions, quality rules, and metadata  
- **Technical Data Stewards / Custodians**: Manage system-level enforcement, data lineage, access control  
- **Data Architects / Analysts**: Support modelling, analytics, and documentation  

> ðŸ’¡ *Tip*: Always distinguish between **ownership (accountability)** and **stewardship (execution)**. Confusing the two leads to overloaded teams and unclear expectations.

## 2. Embedding Governance into Culture

Titles arenâ€™t enoughâ€”leadership must be embedded into the organisationâ€™s day-to-day processes. This means:

- Connecting governance to programme boards, transformation projects, and audit functions  
- Engaging business owners and data producers early  
- Using a **RACI matrix** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) to define who does what

A RACI matrix ensures governance is not theoreticalâ€”itâ€™s visible in how decisions are made.

## 3. Scoping Governance the Right Way

Governance scope defines **what data, departments, or systems** are includedâ€”initially. Scoping everything at once is a mistake. Instead, choose a focused scope based on business value or risk.

### Common Scoping Methods

- **Use Case-Driven**: Focus on data related to a priority like ESG reporting, customer onboarding, or compliance  
- **Risk-Based**: Prioritise domains with the highest regulatory, financial, or reputational exposure  
- **Maturity-Based**: Start where thereâ€™s already a foundationâ€”e.g., teams using data dictionaries or standards

You can also scope:
- **Vertically**: One department or domain (e.g. HR, finance)  
- **Horizontally**: One governance function across all domains (e.g. metadata or access control)

## 4. Governance Scope Statement Template

A useful template to align everyone from day one:

> **Governance Scope Statement â€“ v1.0**  
> **Data Domains**: HR, Finance, Customer  
> **Systems**: ERP, CRM  
> **Departments**: ICT, Finance, Marketing  
> **Use Cases**: GDPR compliance, operational reporting  
> **Exclusions**: Unstructured data, legacy systems (Phase 2)  
> **Review Cycle**: Every 6 months

---

## 5. Pitfalls to Avoid

- Assigning titles without decision-making power  
- Launching with a scope too large to manage  
- Ignoring frontline data creators and modifiers  
- Skipping documentation of roles and responsibilities

---

## 6. What Good Looks Like

- Named leaders across strategic, tactical, and operational roles  
- A visible executive sponsor with budget and authority  
- A scoped and realistic governance focus tied to actual business priorities  
- Documentation and early engagement with affected teams

---

## Summary

Step 1 builds your foundation. Itâ€™s where clarity, alignment, and credibility begin. By identifying leadership and scoping governance with care, you prepare the organisation to take meaningful, measurable next steps.
